# **App Name**: Halliday

## Core Features:

- Faculty Definition: Define faculty members including names, departments, preferences (e.g. preferred halls, time slots).
- Hall Definition: Input and manage available halls with attributes like capacity, available times, and equipment.
- Automated Scheduling: Generate suggested schedules and hall allocations based on defined constraints and faculty preferences using a generative AI tool. Takes into consideration both faculty requirements and hall availabilities, ensuring an efficient match.
- Schedule Visualization: Present the generated schedule in a clear, calendar-like view, showing faculty assignments, halls, and times.
- Manual Adjustments: Provide options to manually adjust the schedule if the automated suggestions aren't suitable. Record any changes that override automated suggestions, allowing manual refinement of the allocation.
- Constraint Settings: Set constraints for scheduling like maximum classes per faculty, preferred time slots for different types of classes (lectures, seminars).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#42A5F5) for reliability and trust in a scheduling application.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), providing a calming, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Light green (#AED581), indicating success when all constraints and preferences can be perfectly satisfied; could be used as the color behind fully 'green lit' entries in a visualization.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif; Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Clear, tabular layouts for schedules and hall details; emphasize legibility of the timetable and hall assignments. Make the layout responsive to allow for tablet-based scheduling on-the-go.
- Consistent use of recognizable icons for various actions (e.g., edit, save, delete, assign).  Icons should relate to scheduling, buildings, and academics, and should support a rapid understanding of functionality. Favor square icons, to work with the machined feel of 'Space Grotesk' and 'Inter'.
- Subtle transitions and animations on data changes or when assigning faculty to halls.  Avoid large movements of content within a screen, as this might confuse the user.
